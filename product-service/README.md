# Product service

## Installation/deployment instructions

Depending on your preferred package manager, follow the instructions below to deploy your project.

> **Requirements**: NodeJS `lts/fermium (v.14.15.0)`. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the same Node version in local and in your lambda's runtime.

### Using NPM

- Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npm test` to run tests
- Run `serverless:deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS
- Run `serverless:remove` to remove this stack to AWS

## Test your service

### Locally

In order to test the hello function locally, run the following command:

- `npx sls invoke local -f hello --path src/functions/hello/mock.json` if you're using NPM

Check the [sls invoke local command documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/invoke-local/) for more information.

### Remotely

Copy and replace your `url` - found in Serverless `deploy` command output - and `name` parameter in the following `curl` command in your terminal or in Postman to test your newly deployed application.

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://myApiEndpoint/dev/hello' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Frederic"
}'
```

### 3rd party libraries

- [json-schema-to-ts](https://github.com/ThomasAribart/json-schema-to-ts) - uses JSON-Schema definitions used by API Gateway for HTTP request validation to statically generate TypeScript types in your lambda's handler code base
- [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) - middleware engine for Node.Js lambda. This template uses [http-json-body-parser](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/master/packages/http-json-body-parser) to convert API Gateway `event.body` property, originally passed as a stringified JSON, to its corresponding parsed object
- [@serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript) - provides up-to-date TypeScript definitions for your `serverless.ts` service file
